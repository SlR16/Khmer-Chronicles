They gave up sugary cereals and ate muesli and oatmeal. Instead of pizza, they ate vegetable stir-fries. And they replaced highly processed meats like ham, sausages and bacon with seafood and small amounts of lean red meats.Importantly, both groups were counseled to continue taking any antidepressants or other medications they were prescribed. The goal of the study was not to see if a healthier diet could replace medication, but whether it could provide additional benefits like exercise, good sleep and other lifestyle behaviors.After 12 weeks, average depression scores improved in both groups, which might be expected for anyone entering a clinical trial that provided additional support, regardless of which group you were in. But depression scores improved to a far greater extent in the group that followed the healthy diet: roughly a third of those people were no longer classified as depressed, compared to 8 percent of people in the control group.",

They also contain large amounts of fiber, unsaturated fat, antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids and other nutrients that have been shown to improve gut and metabolic health and reduce inflammation, all of which can affect the brain.Dr. Ramsey said he does not want people to think that the only factor involved in brain health is food. “Lots of people get their food exactly right, live very active lives, and still have significant troubles with their mental health,” he said.",

The flavour of the dish is reminiscent of a mild Thai red curry.\n\nUsually served in coconut shells, amok trey is the main dish of the Water Festival in Cambodia, celebrating the change of Tonle Sap River's flow, and is a way to thank the Mekong River for providing Cambodia with abundant fish and fertile land. The fish is soaked in a rich curry paste and placed in little steamer cups made from banana leaves, imparting their specific flavor to the dish. "

        "description": "__Bok l’hong__, meaning pounded papaya in Khmer, is a Cambodian take on the green papaya salad that is widely consumed throughout Southeast Asia and is believed to have originated in Laos. Like the Lao and Thai versions, the Cambodian papaya salad usually requires the shredded fruit to be pounded with other ingredients, while the Vietnamese variety doesn't involve pounding of the fruit.\n\nThe salad often contains tamarind, galangal, and prohok, a type of Cambodian fish paste. Bok l'hong can also feature smoked fish or salted crabs, and it is usually consumed with steamed rice and grilled meat such as chicken. One significant difference between the traditional Laotian green papaya salad and the Cambodian version of the salad lies in the use of white fish sauce in the latter instead of the much more pungent fermented fish sauce which is typically used in the former.

For the beef version, a bed of lettuce leaves is traditionally topped with cucumbers, tomatoes, raw onions, and stir-fried beef along with its juices.\n\nThe dish is typically consumed by pulling lettuce leaves from the bottom and adding other ingredients into it, so it is consumed similar to a wrap. Lok lak is often paired with rice on the side, and it was supposedly brought to the country by the French people from Vietnam."
